<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;"><span class="mceItemHidden">CS 373 Spring 2018:&nbsp;Vamsi Ponakala</span></h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 11</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week my group and I finally&nbsp;finished&nbsp;Phase 3 of the project. Overall, we were not pressured by the time restriction we had to do the project (1 week), even though we ran into some trouble. We did struggle a bit on how to implement searching, but we figured it out in the end.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">The one major thing that is in my way is obviously Phase 4 of the project, which is the last phase of our website. Other than that, I don't really have much to do. I feel like Phase 4 of the project will take up the majority of my time on the following weeks, but after that I wont have much to do other than study for midterms, which are early for me. I also have an another essay I have due in a couple of weeks for my global cultures class, so I think I could get started on that and get it over with since I have some time before the next phase of the project.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">As stated above, I will be focusing on&nbsp;Phase 4 of the project. Other than that, I'll probably be catching up in my other classes. Registration for next semester is also coming up in a couple of weeks. Because of this, I have some time to decide exactly what classes I want to take and plan out my schedule accordingly.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My experience of the class has been good so far. From what I have seen of the class, it is good preparation for the future. This week, we've moved away from Python and started exploring SQL. I think this is pretty cool, since we'll be learning a lot more that just some Python tricks, and what we learn for the rest of the semester will be useful in the future. Since we also do example problems in class (like on Hackerrank), we can experiment with implementation of certain ideas too.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">Here&nbsp;https://www.cnbc.com/2018/04/08/cubeyou-cambridge-like-app-collected-data-on-millions-from-facebook.html is another interesting article about Facebook and the data scandal they are currently facing. Mark Zuckerberg is also testifying before Congress next week, so it might be nice to get some background on what is currently happening.</span></p>
