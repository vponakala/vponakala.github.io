<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 2</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week I began looking into the requirements for starting the first project of the semester. I read through the workflow, which detailed the steps that are required to set up the project, and began fumbling my around. I have finished a bit of the project, but now I want to get some more work done every day so I can finish a couple of days before the project deadline.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">The biggest obstacle I think I will&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">face</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">is</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"><span class="mceItemHidden">&nbsp;time and unfamiliarity with the tools we have to use for this project. Setting aside time to work on this project will be tough due to assignments for other classes, but I will make it work somehow. In addition, I also have to use tools I've never used before, like Travis CI, so it is a learning experience.</span></span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This week I will have to finish the Collatz project, since the deadline is approaching. In addition, I will also have to read the textbook in preparation for the daily quizzes we have in class. I underestimated how the quizzes cover material in the textbook, and now I know better.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">I like the structure of the class. At first, it may be intimidating for me because the professor calls on us at random to answer questions, but this method forces me to pay attention in order to not embarrass myself. In addition, the quizzes are a bit of a problem, but now that I've experienced them, I will be&nbsp;ready for next time.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My tip-of-the-week is to actually read the project information the day it is released. If this is done, you can think about strategies and ideas for the project to do a couple of days later. Starting early will also allow you to finish early, and either relax or finish of other demanding assignments from other classes.&nbsp;</span></p>
