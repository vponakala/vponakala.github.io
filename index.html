<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 8</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week I&nbsp;was extremely busy trying to finish up some essays that counted as an exam towards a class I am taking for my global cultures flag. I spent most of the week on this rewatching previous lectures and taking notes, but I also tried to work on the project as well. I am one of the people in charge of working on the front-end so I've been trying to watch videos on React, so that I will be better prepared to do my part.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">The one major thing that is obviously in my way is working on Phase 2 of the project. Our group met a couple more times this week, but that is about it. Not much is in my way since Spring Break is coming up, but the biggest obstacle will be Project 2, which I will try to work on during Spring Break as I am not going anywhere for vacation.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">As stated above, I will be focusing on the project for this class. This Spring Break my family does not have any plans regarding a vacation, so I feel time will be better spend trying to finish as much as I can on what I have been assigned to do. After Spring Break we will have less than a week to finish up the project, so it is best to work on it a bit every day during the break so that we don't fall behind.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My experience of the class has been good so far. From what I have seen of the class, it is good preparation for the future. This week, we've had guest lecturers come and talk to us about different things, like Ethics in Software Engineering. I find it to be a nice change of pace, as it is refreshing to learn about the other aspects of being a software engineer. The in class quizzes have gone a lot better compared to how they were in the beginning of the semester, as well.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My tip-of-the-week is located here&nbsp;</span><a href="https://egghead.io/lessons/react-use-create-react-app-to-setup-a-simple-react-app">https://egghead.io/lessons/react-use-create-react-app-to-setup-a-simple-react-app</a>. This website talks a lot about how to use react and goes through some nice examples.&nbsp;</p>
