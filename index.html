<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;"><span class="mceItemHidden">CS 373 Spring 2018:&nbsp;Vamsi Ponakala</span></h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 1</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What are your expectations of the class?</h1>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">I think my expectations of the class are to learn different tools that will be useful in the industry. Things such as an efficient use of Github and unique platforms such as Docker will definitely&nbsp;be good to know when it is time for me to apply what I learned in school to a job. I also look forward to interacting with people and working as a group to solve projects required for the class, a skill which is also useful in the real world.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week was just the beginning of school, so I did not do much. I dealt mostly with registration and making sure I had the classes I really wanted to take. To do this, I added myself on a couple of waitlists for different CS courses, and waited until I got into at least one of them.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">The biggest obstacle I think I will&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">face</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">is</span><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"><span class="mceItemHidden">&nbsp;time. More specifically, I need to figure out how to efficiently use my time to finish assignments and projects required for my various classes. Unfortunately, I realized this too late last semester, so I am determined not to make the same mistake this time. I plan on learning from my mistakes and moving forward with a different plan.</span></span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p>Based on the syllabus for the class, I will have to start the first project, so I plan on getting a head start on that. Based on the syllabus, the project will&nbsp;be due in a week, so that does not leave much time for me if I decide to procrastinate and start a couple of days before the due date. If I start and finish the project early, I will have more time to do my other assignments in other classes.</p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">I do not know much of what will happen in the class, but I have heard good things from students who have taken Software Engineering and Object Oriented Programming. More specifically, &nbsp;students who have taken these classes say one will be more prepared in the real world, which is really important. I feel as if it is better to learn all I can now, so I can apply myself to a job that counts.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p><span class="mceItemHidden">My tip of the week is to get familiar with Github. I think Github will be used a lot in this class, so it is better to know the specific commands by heart.&nbsp;Various cheat sheets compiled by students are on the Github website, and will be very helpful in the future.</span></p>
