<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;"><span class="mceItemHidden">CS 373 Spring 2018:&nbsp;Vamsi Ponakala</span></h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 5</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week I worked with my group to finish the project, which was due on Thursday. We tried to work diligently on it every day, but of course there were some days where we couldn't all meet up together, so we just worked on our individual parts. I had to go home this past weekend, so I did my part of the project at home. Despite this, we managed to finish the project in time and turn it in, so now we are done with the website until the specs for the second phase of the project are released.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"><span class="mceItemHidden">While I am done with the project now, I still have midterms coming up next week. I had one on the same day the project was due, so that was tough. I finished everything on time, but now it is time to study for the remaining tests until me and my group can start on the next phase of the project.</span></span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">Next week I will have to start on the next phase of the project. Since we have a whole month to finish it, I except there to be a lot of work to be done. In addition, there is also a test coming up in a couple of weeks. I think I am going to prepare for that by doing some practice Hackerrank problems. The test is formatted as such, so it will be good practice for the real thing. In addition, I'll feel more confident using Python.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My experience of the class has been good so far, although I still am not doing so well on the in class quizzes. I feel like I am not preparing enough for them, so I think I have to actively force myself to review all the material the day before class so I will be more prepared for the non-attendance quizzes.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My tip-of-the-week is to&nbsp;not underestimate the amount of time we have for the next project. A month generally seems like a lot of time to finish up a project, but there will probably be many small things that can be easily missed, so it is best to start as soon as you can so you can check for mistakes and have time to improve the project.</span></p>
