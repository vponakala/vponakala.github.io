<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 6</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week I&nbsp;slacked off quite a bit on working on Phase 2 of the project. Even though we have a month to finish it (now 3 weeks as I'm writing this), that is no excuse not to start right away this week. Despite this, this past week has been pretty lax in terms of homework, although I except it to pick up quite a bit as Spring Break approaches. As we are nearing this date, it will give teachers more excuses to pile on the homework and projects for us to do.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"><span class="mceItemHidden">The one major thing that is obviously in my way is working on Phase 2 of the project, and trying to understand all the tools we will need to enhance our website. In addition, Test 1 is coming up for SWE, so I need to study and practice for that as much as possible. Although I have learned much from Professor Downing's lectures in class, there is still so much more that could be on the test, so I plan on going through all the lecture notes on my own time and reading them thoroughly. Doing this and practicing the Hackerrank exercises should be sufficient enough to do well on the test.</span></span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">While the project will be a priority for a while, I will be focusing most of my time on the test next week, since that is next Thursday. I'll probably have to practice Python and JavaScript, since the test will deal with those two languages. Since we gloss over JavaScript in class, I'll have to put in a little more effort learning the basics of that language, which should not be too hard.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">My experience of the class has been good so far. From what I have seen of the class, it is good preparation for the future, as it forces us to leave our comfort zone and use new ideas and tools that might be required when we get jobs in the industry.</p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">My tip-of-the-week is to&nbsp;embrace some physical activity! This might sound odd at first, but it is&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;better that sitting at a computer all day. If I go outside and get some fresh air, as well as do some activities, I find myself more relaxed and ready to face some upcoming challenges.</p>
