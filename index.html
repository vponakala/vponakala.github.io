<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;"><span class="mceItemHidden">CS 373 Spring 2018:&nbsp;Vamsi Ponakala</span></h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 7</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week I&nbsp;slacked off quite a bit on working on Phase 2 of the project, so not much has changed since last week. There was a good reason though, since the test was also this past week. Overall, it was fair, although it would have been nice to get more time to work on the problems. Of course, the blame is partly mine, since I should have paced myself better. Despite this, it's time to put this behind me and work on the project, as the deadline is slowly approaching.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"><span class="mceItemHidden">The one major thing that is obviously in my way is working on Phase 2 of the project. Our group has met a few times this past week, and we plan on meeting more often before Spring Break approaches. There will not be time to meet up during break, since my teammates will be doing their own thing, so it is best to get as much done as possible. By then, we should have our roles clearly defined and should have most of our assigned work for the project finished.</span></span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">As stated above, I will be focusing on the project for this class. In addition, I have two essays due on Thursday. They have to be three to four pages long, each double-spaced. Although this does not sound like much, it is still a lot of work, so I am going to try on finishing them as soon as possible, so that I can allocate more time for the project, which should require most of my attention.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My experience of the class has been good so far. From what I have seen of the class, it is good preparation for the future. In addition, we don't learn just one thing through the whole semester: We leap around different tools and languages, adding them to our toolbox so that we can use what we have learned in the future.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My tip-of-the-week is to&nbsp;communicate with more people around you. When one finally gets a job, social skills are a must, so it is good practice and wise to learn such things right now. Getting to know your peers will help in the long run.</span></p>
