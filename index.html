<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;"><span class="mceItemHidden">CS 373 Spring 2018:&nbsp;Vamsi Ponakala</span></h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 3</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week I had to finish up the Collatz project. I originally estimated I would complete the project in about 10 hours, but I underestimated how much set up was required for the project. Because of that, it took longer than I thought, but I managed to finish the project on time, taking me around 20 hours. In addition to this, I also had my first declarative programming assignment assigned, but I did not get much time to work on that since Collatz was due on Thursday.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">Since I finished the first major project for this class, there is not much in my way for now. Other than that, the only major obstacle I have is another project for my other Computer Science class, but that should not take long. Ever since I finished Collatz, I feel like I have a better understanding of the tools needed in the class, and I will be&nbsp;ready for the next project, which <span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;">will be assigned</span> next week.</span></span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">Next week I will have to finish up my declarative programming assignment. In addition I also have to find a group for our next project in the class. I am already in a group with 3 other people, but the project requires us to have at least 5-6 people in our group, so a post will be put up on Piazza trying to find a couple of more members. There are also a few other things which are not related to school which have to be taken care of, like trying to find a place to live next year.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">Based on the first project, I learned things such as what I am in for during the rest of the semester, and how much work I am going to have to put in to do good in the class. On the other hand, I think I learned more about the various tools we use for the class, and how they can be useful in the real world.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My tip-of-the-week is to not constantly work on one thing for hours on end. I made that mistake during the Collatz project, and I think I would have been better off trying to space myself out. If you get frustrated on a problem (Hackerrank), it is best to take a step back and take a break before trying to tackle the problem again.</span></p>
