<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Final Entry</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did&nbsp;I like most about the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">Overall, I enjoyed the course and learned a lot from it. One thing I liked the most about the class was the content of the lectures. We did not really learn the basics of each language, but instead added on to that certain tips and tricks that would be useful for the future.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did&nbsp;I like least&nbsp;about the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">The one thing I liked least about the class was how the project was split up. In the beginning phases we were not given that much time to work on it, which makes sense, since that was just the beginning phases of the project. After we got to the dynamic part of the website, our given time varied between phases, which made it difficult to finish certain things on time.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What is the most significant thing you learned?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">The most significant thing I learned was probably how to create a website, and how to make it dynamic. I never realized how many tools and work it took to create one, so now I have more of an appreciation for these sort of things.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">How many hours did you spend coding and reading for the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">An estimate to the amout of hours I spent coding would probably be around 5-10 hours per week, since it took a lot of work to finish the project. For the number of lines of code, it is easily over 200+, and I probably spent an hour a week reading.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What required tools did you find useful?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">I never really had to use Amazon Web Services, so I didn't know much about it. During this project, however, since it was a requirement, I learned there were a bunch of benefits to using AWS. If you're a student, you get even more free stuff. In terms of Web dev tools, I think using Flask-Restless was extremely useful, as it made backend development easier.</p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What would you change about the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">I would probably want to skip over some of the JavaScript stuff we did in favor of more Python tips. JavaScript does not seem to be as useful as Python in development, so it would have been nice to explore more of that language.</p>

<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 12</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week my group and I finally started on Phase 4 of the project. For this project, we have to listen to the input of another group and based on the issues that they give us, we fix on our website. In addition, we also have to prepare for a presentation in which we present our website to the whole class.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">The one major thing that is in my way is obviously Phase 4 of the project, which is the last phase of our website. Other than that, I don't really have much to do. I feel like Phase 4 of the project will take up the majority of my time on the following weeks, but after that I wont have much to do other than study for midterms, which are early for me. I also have an another&nbsp;project I have due in a couple of weeks for another class, so I&nbsp;have to get that finished&nbsp;so that I have enough time to finish up Phase 4 of the project.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">As stated above, I will be focusing on&nbsp;Phase 4 of the project. Other than that, I'll probably be catching up in my other classes. Registration for next semester is also coming up in this&nbsp;week. Because of this, I have some time to decide exactly what classes I want to take and plan out my schedule accordingly.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My experience of the class has been good so far. From what I have seen of the class, it is good preparation for the future. This week, we've moved away from Python and started exploring SQL. I think this is pretty cool, since we'll be learning a lot more that just some Python tricks, and what we learn for the rest of the semester will be useful in the future. Since we also do example problems in class (like on Hackerrank), we can experiment with implementation of certain ideas too. In addition, we are working a bit more with Java.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">Something I found interesting is that Facebook can tell exactly what your political orientation is. To do this, you go to Settings -&gt; Account -&gt; Ads. Here, based on your history on Facebook, it will tell you what it thinks you orientation is.</p>

<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week my group and I finally&nbsp;finished&nbsp;Phase 3 of the project. Overall, we were not pressured by the time restriction we had to do the project (1 week), even though we ran into some trouble. We did struggle a bit on how to implement searching, but we figured it out in the end.</span></p>

<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week my group and I finally started&nbsp;on Phase 3 of the project. Since we only had a week to do it, we started as early as possible. On paper, it does not look like much, since we just have to implement certain features for our website (searching, filtering, and sorting), but along with this we also have to add more tests to our code.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">The one major thing that is in my way is obviously Phase 3 of the project, since that is due on Thursday of the coming week. Other than that, I don't really have much to do. Of course, the Phase 3 of the project will take up the majority of my time on the following week I also have an essay I have due in a couple of weeks for my global cultures class, so I think I could get started on that and get it over with since I have some time before the next phase of the project.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">As stated above, I will be focusing on&nbsp;Phase 3 of the project. Other than that, I'll probably be catching up in my other classes. In Phase 3, I am in charge of implementing the sorting of each model grid page. I feel like after I figure out how to do one page, the rest will come naturally, since only a few things will need to be changed for each grid.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>

<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week my group and I finally finished up Phase 2 of the project. It took a suprising amount of work, but we managed to get in done in time. Of course, we had a month to finish the project, but we did the bulk of the work in the last couple of weeks. The project got off to a slow start, but we got whatever we needed to get done, and now we have to wait for Phase 3 of the project to be released.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">The one major thing that is in my way is a test next week on Tuesday. Other than that, I don't really have much to do. Of course, the specs for Phase 3 of the project could be released this week, so I could probably look over that in preparation for the next phase. I also have an essay I have due in a couple of weeks for my global cultures class, so I think I could get started on that and get it over with since I have some time before the next phase of the project.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">As stated above, I will be focusing on the&nbsp;test I <span class="hiddenGrammarError">have next week</span>. Other than that, I'll probably be catching up in my other classes and trying to prepare for the next phase of the project. In Phase 3, we will not have as much time as the previous phase (only a couple of weeks compared to the month we had) so my and my group will <span class="hiddenSpellError">definitly</span> get started early <span class="hiddenSuggestion">in order to</span> finish on time.</span></p>

<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week I&nbsp;was extremely busy trying to finish up some essays that counted as an exam towards a class I am taking for my global cultures flag. I spent most of the week on this rewatching previous lectures and taking notes, but I also tried to work on the project as well. I am one of the people in charge of working on the front-end so I've been trying to watch videos on React, so that I will be better prepared to do my part.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">The one major thing that is obviously in my way is working on Phase 2 of the project. Our group met a couple more times this week, but that is about it. Not much is in my way since Spring Break is coming up, but the biggest obstacle will be Project 2, which I will try to work on during Spring Break as I am not going anywhere for vacation.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">As stated above, I will be focusing on the project for this class. This Spring Break my family does not have any plans regarding a vacation, so I feel time will be better spend trying to finish as much as I can on what I have been assigned to do. After Spring Break we will have less than a week to finish up the project, so it is best to work on it a bit every day during the break so that we don't fall behind.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My experience of the class has been good so far. From what I have seen of the class, it is good preparation for the future. This week, we've had guest lecturers come and talk to us about different things, like Ethics in Software Engineering. I find it to be a nice change of pace, as it is refreshing to learn about the other aspects of being a software engineer. The in class quizzes have gone a lot better compared to how they were in the beginning of the semester, as well.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My tip-of-the-week is located here&nbsp;</span><a href="https://egghead.io/lessons/react-use-create-react-app-to-setup-a-simple-react-app">https://egghead.io/lessons/react-use-create-react-app-to-setup-a-simple-react-app</a>. This website talks a lot about how to use react and goes through some nice examples.&nbsp;</p>

<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week I&nbsp;slacked off quite a bit on working on Phase 2 of the project, so not much has changed since last week. There was a good reason though, since the test was also this past week. Overall, it was fair, although it would have been nice to get more time to work on the problems. Of course, the blame is partly mine, since I should have paced myself better. Despite this, it's time to put this behind me and work on the project, as the deadline is slowly approaching.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"><span class="mceItemHidden">The one major thing that is obviously in my way is working on Phase 2 of the project. Our group has met a few times this past week, and we plan on meeting more often before Spring Break approaches. There will not be time to meet up during break, since my teammates will be doing their own thing, so it is best to get as much done as possible. By then, we should have our roles clearly defined and should have most of our assigned work for the project finished.</span></span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">As stated above, I will be focusing on the project for this class. In addition, I have two essays due on Thursday. They have to be three to four pages long, each double-spaced. Although this does not sound like much, it is still a lot of work, so I am going to try on finishing them as soon as possible, so that I can allocate more time for the project, which should require most of my attention.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My experience of the class has been good so far. From what I have seen of the class, it is good preparation for the future. In addition, we don't learn just one thing through the whole semester: We leap around different tools and languages, adding them to our toolbox so that we can use what we have learned in the future.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My tip-of-the-week is to&nbsp;communicate with more people around you. When one finally gets a job, social skills are a must, so it is good practice and wise to learn such things right now. Getting to know your peers will help in the long run.</span></p>

<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week I&nbsp;slacked off quite a bit on working on Phase 2 of the project. Even though we have a month to finish it (now 3 weeks as I'm writing this), that is no excuse not to start right away this week. Despite this, this past week has been pretty lax in terms of homework, although I except it to pick up quite a bit as Spring Break approaches. As we are nearing this date, it will give teachers more excuses to pile on the homework and projects for us to do.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"><span class="mceItemHidden">The one major thing that is obviously in my way is working on Phase 2 of the project, and trying to understand all the tools we will need to enhance our website. In addition, Test 1 is coming up for SWE, so I need to study and practice for that as much as possible. Although I have learned much from Professor Downing's lectures in class, there is still so much more that could be on the test, so I plan on going through all the lecture notes on my own time and reading them thoroughly. Doing this and practicing the Hackerrank exercises should be sufficient enough to do well on the test.</span></span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">While the project will be a priority for a while, I will be focusing most of my time on the test next week, since that is next Thursday. I'll probably have to practice Python and JavaScript, since the test will deal with those two languages. Since we gloss over JavaScript in class, I'll have to put in a little more effort learning the basics of that language, which should not be too hard.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">My experience of the class has been good so far. From what I have seen of the class, it is good preparation for the future, as it forces us to leave our comfort zone and use new ideas and tools that might be required when we get jobs in the industry.</p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">My tip-of-the-week is to&nbsp;embrace some physical activity! This might sound odd at first, but it is&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;better that sitting at a computer all day. If I go outside and get some fresh air, as well as do some activities, I find myself more relaxed and ready to face some upcoming challenges.</p>

<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week I worked with my group to finish the project, which was due on Thursday. We tried to work diligently on it every day, but of course there were some days where we couldn't all meet up together, so we just worked on our individual parts. I had to go home this past weekend, so I did my part of the project at home. Despite this, we managed to finish the project in time and turn it in, so now we are done with the website until the specs for the second phase of the project are released.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"><span class="mceItemHidden">While I am done with the project now, I still have midterms coming up next week. I had one on the same day the project was due, so that was tough. I finished everything on time, but now it is time to study for the remaining tests until me and my group can start on the next phase of the project.</span></span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">Next week I will have to start on the next phase of the project. Since we have a whole month to finish it, I except there to be a lot of work to be done. In addition, there is also a test coming up in a couple of weeks. I think I am going to prepare for that by doing some practice Hackerrank problems. The test is formatted as such, so it will be good practice for the real thing. In addition, I'll feel more confident using Python.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My experience of the class has been good so far, although I still am not doing so well on the in class quizzes. I feel like I am not preparing enough for them, so I think I have to actively force myself to review all the material the day before class so I will be more prepared for the non-attendance quizzes.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My tip-of-the-week is to&nbsp;not underestimate the amount of time we have for the next project. A month generally seems like a lot of time to finish up a project, but there will probably be many small things that can be easily missed, so it is best to start as soon as you can so you can check for mistakes and have time to improve the project.</span></p>

<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 4</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week I joined a group to start the next project required for the class. At first, we had a team of five, but after a Canvas situation, one more person joined our group a couple of days later to make it a group of six. I think this will work out just fine, since the more people we have, the faster we can finish the project. Of course, there is always the issue with working cohesively with people you don't know, but after meeting a couple of times, I think we'll be just fine.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"><span class="mceItemHidden">In addition to this project being due on Thursday, I also have a test for declarative programming on the same day. I plan on studying for it a few days before the real exam date. Usually, I only give myself a couple of days to review the material before the real test, but for this class, I want to give myself some extra time to study, since some of the material taught in the class is somewhat confusing.</span></span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">Next week I will have to finish up this project, since it is due on Thursday.&nbsp;By now, I have met up with my group a couple of times and we have divided up the work between us. In addition to this, I think we will also try to meet when our schedules allow it to see the progress each of us have made. By doing this, other group members will be kept in the loop, and others can request help if needed.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">Based on&nbsp;the classes I have went to so far, they seem like a quick refresher on various programming languages. For example, we went through various syntax rules in Python, and the difference between == and .equals in Python vs Java. In class, I can learn these little details and commit them to memory, since they seem to be very useful.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My tip-of-the-week is to&nbsp;be more social in classrooms. By talking to a couple of people next to you and getting to know them, you build up a relationship which can then be furthered in situations such as finding a group for a group project. No one wants to be that one person who joins a group of strangers, so it is better to join a group of friends.</span></p>

<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 3</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week I managed to finish the Collatz project without too much of a problem. Hackerrank was the real problem, though, as the optimization tests for the Collatz code took forever to pass, since there were certain elements I did not add to my code to optimize it. I had to go to office hours to figure out what the problem was. At first, I wanted to figure out what the problem was myself, but then I realized I was running out of time before the project was due. Because of this, I forced my self to go get help. I am glad I did though, because the TA's were extremely helpful and helped me figure out the miniscule solution that was required to pass the optimization test.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">The one major thing that is in my way is obviously the next phase of the project, since I have to find a group for this phase. I am not really sure how this project is going to go, but hopefully after reading the specs for the project, me and my future team will have some idea on what to do. There will be a bunch of setup to do for the project, but I think we can do it if we work together.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">I will probably have to catch up in my other classes, like in my other computer science class. The material we are learning is already starting to be difficult, so I am going to have to catch up on the reading to get to where we are currently.</p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">I like how the class is now starting to delve into Python-specific details now. I already had some background on Python and how it worked, but I am still learning new things. Python certainly seems easier than other languages I've worked with, but I'm sure there are some exceptions.</p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">My pick-of-the-week would be using Slack, a communication tool for projects. I've heard that Slack is essential for the project that we are going to be working on this semester, so it is better to get a head start on learning the specifics of this tool.</p>

<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 2</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week I'm still trying to get into the groove of things, like finding out where all my classes are, and making sure I get there on time. The work has not picked up yet, so I have not done much other than actually go to the first few classes of each of my courses.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">There's really nothing in my way other than some readings I have to do for this class. I feel like the readings are going to be really important for the semester, so I am going to try to read at least an hour a day. Of course, if that doesn't work out, I try to keep that time up per week. That way, I'll have at least prepared something for class.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">Next week I will have to finish the Collatz project, the first major project of the class. I have been slightly slacking off on that, so I think I need to get a move on and finish the project as early as possible. I've read through the specs for the project, but I still don't really understand what to do. Of course, I've never really used Hackerrank before, so that is probably it, so I'll have to adjust accordingly. I'll also have to brush up on some Python, since I will have to code the project in that language. We are learning things about Python, but it is nice to learn somethings on your own once in a while.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">So far, the class seems interesting enough. It is kind of slow, since we are starting at the basics, but I am pretty sure it will start to pick up and gain traction. We just started learning about Python and Collatz and how they go together, which should be useful for the project.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My pick-of-the-week would be to use some version of version control, like Github for projects. It might now have happened to everyone, but there has been too many times where I've accidentally lost some of my code and did not have a backup. No one ever wants to be in this situation, so it is wise to have backups.</span></p>

<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;"><span class="mceItemHidden">CS 373 Spring 2018:&nbsp;Vamsi Ponakala</span></h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 1</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What are my expectations of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">I think I expect to learn a lot more about Python. I have some sort of background in that language, but not much. I also haven't really had to use it in projects or in class, so it is nice to finally go into more depth so that I may have a better understanding about the language for future things.</p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did I do this past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">I did not really do much this past week other than go to class. It is still the beginning of the semester, so people are still trying to figure out their schedule and where their classes are. Because of this, things are still pretty slow now. Even though I've only gone to a couple of lectures so far, I have already learned more about the intricacies of Python from this class.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in my way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">Some obstacles I will probably encounter are probably schedule and class related. A lot of people have this problem, with it being the start of a brand new year and semester. My schedule is pretty packed this semester, and unfortunately, I still feel pretty lazy from Winter Break. I'll have to fix this for the upcoming semester, so I'll make that one of my goals. I think I'll also try to go to as many classes as possible, since I don't want to fall behind in any classes. It is so easy to skip class, but there is no benefit in that. Because of this, I'll force myself to keep up attendance in class.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will I do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">Next week, I will keep on going to class and try to learn as much as possible. I'll also try to prepare for the daily quizzes, since if I fall behind, I won't be prepared enough for those quizzes, and that would be very bad.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">So far the class has been a great but also a new experience. I've never had daily quizzes like these, which is a change of pace, since it forces me to keep up. I've also never had a teacher who calls on random people during class, so it will keep me on my toes in case the professor calls on me during class.</p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My pick-of-the-week would be to use&nbsp;unit tests for your code! You might be confident in what you have written, but there are always those nasty edge cases and exceptions that might slip your mind once a while. To not encounter this problem, it is best to thoroughly test your code so that you can be fully confident in it.</span></p>
