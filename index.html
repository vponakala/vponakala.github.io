<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;"><span class="mceItemHidden">CS 373 Spring 2018:&nbsp;Vamsi Ponakala</span></h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 4</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week I joined a group to start the next project required for the class. At first, we had a team of five, but after a Canvas situation, one more person joined our group a couple of days later to make it a group of six. I think this will work out just fine, since the more people we have, the faster we can finish the project. Of course, there is always the issue with working cohesively with people you don't know, but after meeting a couple of times, I think we'll be just fine.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 11px;"><span class="mceItemHidden">In addition to this project being due on Thursday, I also have a test for declarative programming on the same day. I plan on studying for it a few days before the real exam date. Usually, I only give myself a couple of days to review the material before the real test, but for this class, I want to give myself some extra time to study, since some of the material taught in the class is somewhat confusing.</span></span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">Next week I will have to finish up this project, since it is due on Thursday.&nbsp;By now, I have met up with my group a couple of times and we have divided up the work between us. In addition to this, I think we will also try to meet when our schedules allow it to see the progress each of us have made. By doing this, other group members will be kept in the loop, and others can request help if needed.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">Based on&nbsp;the classes I have went to so far, they seem like a quick refresher on various programming languages. For example, we went through various syntax rules in Python, and the difference between == and .equals in Python vs Java. In class, I can learn these little details and commit them to memory, since they seem to be very useful.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My tip-of-the-week is to&nbsp;be more social in classrooms. By talking to a couple of people next to you and getting to know them, you build up a relationship which can then be furthered in situations such as finding a group for a group project. No one wants to be that one person who joins a group of strangers, so it is better to join a group of friends.</span></p>
