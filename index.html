<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 10</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>

<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week my group and I finally started&nbsp;on Phase 3 of the project. Since we only had a week to do it, we started as early as possible. On paper, it does not look like much, since we just have to implement certain features for our website (searching, filtering, and sorting), but along with this we also have to add more tests to our code.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">The one major thing that is in my way is obviously Phase 3 of the project, since that is due on Thursday of the coming week. Other than that, I don't really have much to do. Of course, the Phase 3 of the project will take up the majority of my time on the following week I also have an essay I have due in a couple of weeks for my global cultures class, so I think I could get started on that and get it over with since I have some time before the next phase of the project.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">As stated above, I will be focusing on&nbsp;Phase 3 of the project. Other than that, I'll probably be catching up in my other classes. In Phase 3, I am in charge of implementing the sorting of each model grid page. I feel like after I figure out how to do one page, the rest will come naturally, since only a few things will need to be changed for each grid.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">My experience of the class has been good so far. From what I have seen of the class, it is good preparation for the future. This week, we've moved away from Python and started exploring SQL. I think this is pretty cool, since we'll be learning a lot more that just some Python tricks, and what we learn for the rest of the semester will be useful in the future. Since we also do example problems in class (like on Hackerrank), we can experiment with implementation of certain ideas too.</p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">Here&nbsp;https://gitpitch.com/quangmire/cs373-swe?p=idb3&nbsp;are interesting slides on how to get started on searching and sorting. This was already presented in class, but it's nice to have a reference to it at all times.</span></p>
