<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;"><span class="mceItemHidden">CS 373 Spring 2018:&nbsp;Vamsi Ponakala</span></h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 12</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week my group and I finally started on Phase 4 of the project. For this project, we have to listen to the input of another group and based on the issues that they give us, we fix on our website. In addition, we also have to prepare for a presentation in which we present our website to the whole class.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">The one major thing that is in my way is obviously Phase 4 of the project, which is the last phase of our website. Other than that, I don't really have much to do. I feel like Phase 4 of the project will take up the majority of my time on the following weeks, but after that I wont have much to do other than study for midterms, which are early for me. I also have an another&nbsp;project I have due in a couple of weeks for another class, so I&nbsp;have to get that finished&nbsp;so that I have enough time to finish up Phase 4 of the project.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">As stated above, I will be focusing on&nbsp;Phase 4 of the project. Other than that, I'll probably be catching up in my other classes. Registration for next semester is also coming up in this&nbsp;week. Because of this, I have some time to decide exactly what classes I want to take and plan out my schedule accordingly.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">My experience of the class has been good so far. From what I have seen of the class, it is good preparation for the future. This week, we've moved away from Python and started exploring SQL. I think this is pretty cool, since we'll be learning a lot more that just some Python tricks, and what we learn for the rest of the semester will be useful in the future. Since we also do example problems in class (like on Hackerrank), we can experiment with implementation of certain ideas too. In addition, we are working a bit more with Java.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">Something I found interesting is that Facebook can tell exactly what your political orientation is. To do this, you go to Settings -&gt; Account -&gt; Ads. Here, based on your history on Facebook, it will tell you what it thinks you orientation is.</p>
