<h1 class="center" style="text-align: center;">Week 9</h1>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">&nbsp;</h1>

<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What did you do the past week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">This past week my group and I finally finished up Phase 2 of the project. It took a suprising amount of work, but we managed to get in done in time. Of course, we had a month to finish the project, but we did the bulk of the work in the last couple of weeks. The project got off to a slow start, but we got whatever we needed to get done, and now we have to wait for Phase 3 of the project to be released.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's in your way?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">The one major thing that is in my way is a test next week on Tuesday. Other than that, I don't really have much to do. Of course, the specs for Phase 3 of the project could be released this week, so I could probably look over that in preparation for the next phase. I also have an essay I have due in a couple of weeks for my global cultures class, so I think I could get started on that and get it over with since I have some time before the next phase of the project.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What will you do next week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;"><span class="mceItemHidden">As stated above, I will be focusing on the&nbsp;test I <span class="hiddenGrammarError">have next week</span>. Other than that, I'll probably be catching up in my other classes and trying to prepare for the next phase of the project. In Phase 3, we will not have as much time as the previous phase (only a couple of weeks compared to the month we had) so my and my group will <span class="hiddenSpellError">definitly</span> get started early <span class="hiddenSuggestion">in order to</span> finish on time.</span></p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my experience of the class?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">My experience of the class has been good so far. From what I have seen of the class, it is good preparation for the future. This week, we've moved away from Python and started exploring SQL. I think this is pretty cool, since we'll be learning a lot more that just some Python tricks, and what we learn for the rest of the semester will be useful in the future.&nbsp;</p>
<h1 class="center" style="text-align: left;">What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?</h1>
<p style="text-align: left;">Here&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/25/17160944/facebook-call-history-sms-data-collection-android">https://www.theverge.com/2018/3/25/17160944/facebook-call-history-sms-data-collection-android</a><span class="mceItemHidden">&nbsp;is an interesting article <span class="hiddenSuggestion">regarding</span> the drama Facebook is facing over how they have been secretly collecting call history and data from Android devices.</span></p>
